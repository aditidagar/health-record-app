## **Goal for collaborative work as a team**

As a team we’re excited to learn new frameworks and put our existing skills to good
use when working on the project. We plan on having regular meetings to keep each
other posted on the progress while also checking up on each other in case one
person needs help finishing the task assigned to them. We also intend on
experimenting with peer programming in the initial weeks and continue with the
approach if it yields positive results.

As is the case with every group assignment, teammates are bound to disagree and
conflicts will arise. Non-responsiveness is a major downfall to many group
projects, especially when deadlines are nearing, with each individual having
their own responsibilities it is vital that the entire group stays on track and
has their user stories completed on time. Our focus is to finish the task at
hand, if an individual was to be unresponsive, the remaining members would
equally split the load.

Since we are a large group, it will be nearly impossible for any decision based
on tech stack or implementation to be unanimous. We have already discussed that
certain members may feel less comfortable with the languages/frameworks we
choose to use for this project, however, we have decided to split the
implementation in a manner such that either each individual has had experience
with the language, or is doing something similar enough to a point where the
learning curve won't be too steep.

## **Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints.**

This project is more back-end heavy as compared to front end when it comes to the
actual implementation. The UI aspect would be fairly basic as compared to the
work put in the back-end. That is precisely why we have decided to have 5
back-end and 2 front-end developers.

Aside from the development roles, we have one scrum master who would be
responsible for ensuring that every team member adheres to the agreed upon agile
principles. He/She is also responsible for holding regular scrum meetings as
requested or needed.


| Group Member   |      Strengths     |  Limitations |
|----------|------------- |------|
| Jason Lee |  ReactJS, JSON, REST web apis | CI, front end testing |
| Lakshya Gupta |  Node.js, MongoDB, CI/CD, Deployment, AWS   |  Front-end testing, UI design |
| Viktor Zhuang | Front end design (UI), REST APIs, JSON, documentation |  Node.js, React, CI/deployment |
| Parshva Shah |    reactjs, node.js, deployment   |   Front end testing |
| Aditi Dagar |    Node.js, MongoDB, Testing (Mocha, Artillery) |   CI, Front-end (UI) |
| Hamza Mahfooz |    react, node.js (express),context free grammars/parsing   | Fluid front end design, CI  |
| Mike (Zhipeng Lin) |   Node js, express API, MongoDB, UML design  |  REACT framework, front-end stuff |



## **Describe how you will hold meetings:**

We plan on holding meetings every Saturday evening aside from the meeting we have on Tuesdays.
Depending on the workload for the week and everyone's availibility we might schedule extra meetings.
Meeting will usually be an hour long where we begin by discussing the progress made on the previous week’s
tasks which will be followed by distributing duties for the upcoming week. Aside
from weekly meetings we’ll use Discord to communicate with each other. We will
also be maintaining a Trello board for weekly updates and organizing duties.

## **Shared documents:**

We will be using this [Google Docs Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mgRMB-IASbrJsJtM8UrLqs-v_E-oxCh4?usp=sharing) to keep track of the points discussed in each weekly
meeting. It will also be used for drafting all MD files required for deliverable 1.


# **Our Project Management Methodology**

We will be using the Kanban method to design, manage and consistently improve our workflow. We will use this [trello board](https://trello.com/b/D8fjUiXN/csc302-project) to visualise our work.

We will assign tasks weekly. While assigning tasks we will keep in mind that
they should be doable within a weeks time and that team members will also have
other commitments and deadlines to meet other than the ones for this project.
Therefore we will exercise some leniency when setting deadlines. However we will
all strive to finish the tasks assigned to us in time so that there are no
delays. Lakshya will assume the role of a scrum master and oversee the project workflow.


## **Create a strategy for how to divide work between individuals:**
Front-end Members: Parshva, Viktor\
Back-end Members:Aditi, Lakshya, Hamza, Jason, Mike\
CI Person: Lakshya \
TDD Person: Aditi \
Repo Man: Parshva\
All shared documents will be stored inside the team folder on Google Drive.

## **Messaging: what will you use as a message board? How will you track your progress?**

We will be using Discord as our message board. We will regularly check and update the list on Trello. We will also hold weekly
meetings to track our progress. The scrum master will oversee the overall progress.
